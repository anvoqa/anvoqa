# How can QA teams improve their efficiency and speed up testing without sacrificing quality?

Recently, I came across this topic on social media and I kept thinking about it. 

When it comes to this question, many people immediately think of automated testing implementation. Yes, automation can improve the speed of testing.

However, are there any other ways besides automation approach. Let's look at this topic holistically

Are you having good development process that allow your team to deliver feature with quality?

How much time your team is spending on bug fixes vs. feature development?

When is your QA team spending time on testing?

Who is responsible for quality and testing?

How are you going to implement automated testing?

How do you know your QA team has improved testing efficiency without sacrificing quality?
